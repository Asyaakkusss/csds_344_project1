Traffic lights

This simulation uses traffic lights and a four-way crossing visual to demonstrate the way in which vehicular and pedestrian traffic are managed safely. This includes moving pedestrian traffic appropriately while allowing other movable vehicle traffic in other directions. You can safely pass right, left and through pass vehicle traffic at the intersection. 

Design
1. Synch the timing of color changes timing of lights facing the opposite directions (i.e. light facing north and south should be the same color at the same time)
2. When north/south facing lights are green or yellow then east/west facing lights should be red ( and v.v.)
3. Transition of colors should be green for x seconds then yellow for y seconds then red for z seconds then back to green

4. Anticipate all secure and unsecure states and implement mechanisms (traffic light sequences) to ensure a secure state

Implementation
Write and test code to satisfy the design of the secure state for both vehicle and pedestrian traffic

Code in any language (Python preferred) but MUST present running code and simulated traffic lights in code GUI
